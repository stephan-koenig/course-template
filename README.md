# Course template

The main feature of this course template is a landing page with a schedule table allowing students to navigate to all the course materials.
Website is automatically deployed using GH Actions to GitHub Pages.

## Edit the template for your course

There are a few things you need to do to adapt this template for your course.

1. In `_variables.yml`, you can define variables that are used across the entire Quarto project using the shortcode `{{< var <key> >}}` (reference sub-keys using the dot, `.`, delimiter, e.g.,`code` listed under `course` is referenced as `course.code`; [more details](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/variables.html#var)).
Replace the placeholders provided for the variables, for example, update `course.code` and `course.title`.

2. The `_quarto.yml` file controls [Quarto project settings](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html) including [website options (such as navigation)](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html).
Most important, update `site-url` and `repo-url`.

3. To enable the schedule table, you will need to provide the dates when different units of the course will happen in the `/data/schedules.csv` file.

4. In addition, any extra resources that are not Quarto documents, such as links to lecture recordings and to PrairieLearn, are provided in the file `/data/additional-resources.csv`.

## Website notes

The course schedule is dynamically generated from the files the directories `pre-activities`, `activities`, `slides` and `summaries` using R (more specifically, `render_schedule()` in `/R/render-schedule.csv`).
Having documents organized this way allows them to be formatted with `_metadata.yml` files in their directories.

- There are four different types of `<unit>`s: `class`, `lab`, `potw` and `exam`.
- There are the following `<types>` of resources: `summaries`, `pre-activities`, `activities`, `slides`, `recording`, `practice` and `link`.
- All resources belonging together have a unique `<id>` consisting of their `<unit>` followed by a two-digit number, e.g., `class-01`.
- Files belonging to one unit should be named following the pattern: `<id>_<type>`.
- `id` is a unique identifier to join resources for all related resources to generate the schedule table.

## Setup

We recommend developing content locally on your computer in a container accessed by [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/).
Follow the setup instructions outlined in [Developing inside a Container using Visual Studio Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) including the installation of Docker and the Open VSX extension [Container tools](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-containers).
As of Positron version 2026.01.0-147, you need to enable the experimental [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) support with the [`dev.containers.enable`](positron://settings/dev.containers.enable) setting.
After cloning this repo locally to your computer, open the directory using the command **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...** from the Command Palette in Positron.
